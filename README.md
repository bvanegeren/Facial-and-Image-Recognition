# Facial-and-Image-Recognition
This repository contains two projects that I completed with a partner.
The project 1 files use Linear SVC and PDA modeling in an attempt to identify images with people wearing face masks.
Project 2 is a facial recognition program utilizing a CNN model. This is slightly different from facial recognition with masks, as it also tries to
identify the name belonging to the image.
